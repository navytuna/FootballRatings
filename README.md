This project is one meant only for CompSci. If you somehow find some use for any of this then go ahead and use it.

Looks like I'm going to have to (generally) scrap this and start over, but I'm not sure just how much I will have to do. This will be... interesting. Ah well. No sense delaying any longer if I want to catch some Zs tonight. They truly are quick on their feet.*

**9:15 PM, EST, 07/11/2017** - *Yeah, I fucked up. Hard. I will have to move mountains to do everything right and get back on track. I'm terrified. I need to do something... I know what needs done, I know I am capable of it, but I simply do nothing to move to that goal. I don't know what will make me move to do my work short of completely shutting myself off from the friends and stuff I have made, carefully grown, and love. I don't know what I would do without them, and frankly, they are providing me a good portion of my motivation to simply persist. Fuck, an hour to do all of this? I'll have to move incredibly fast to do it, and even then... I don't know anymore. I am very afraid. I need help, but I am not willing to reach out for it. I need to talk to people about this, but I don't want to force those close to me, nor those who I care about, to suffer because of this. I'm not sure what I'm going to do, but I need to decide.*
